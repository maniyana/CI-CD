For example, from the command line we could navigate to the Help/guide/tutorial directory of the CMake source code tree and create a build directory:

mkdir Step1_build
Next, navigate to the build directory and run CMake to configure the project and generate a native build system:

cd Step1_build
cmake ../Step1
Then call that build system to actually compile/link the project:

cmake --build .
Finally, try to use the newly built Tutorial with these commands:
